# Confidence Ellipse

## Description

This VBA code is useful for creating confidence ellipses with multivariate data, as discussed in the following papers:
- [Integration of confidence ellipses in the evaluation and development of centrifugal fans](Paper2.pdf)
- [Application of the confidence ellipse as support for the precision analysis in measuring the concentration of water in oil emulsions](Paper1.pdf)

The code is designed to be run within Excel, allowing users to work with confidence ellipses in both educational and industrial contexts. Users can modify the confidence interval, variance, mean, correlation, and multivariate points in real time.

The main goal is to enable users to interactively work with confidence ellipses, utilizing VBA programming for calculations and visualizations directly in Excel.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Excel file containing the VBA macros.
3. Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel.
4. Run the desired VBA routines directly from the VBA editor or assign them to buttons in your Excel sheets.
5. The code includes detailed comments and auxiliary figures to help you understand its functionality.

## Worksheets Used

- **Dashboard**: Confidence ellipses and all possible modifications.
- **Data**: Data used to construct the confidence ellipse.
